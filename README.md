CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language designed to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
It allows you to apply styles to HTML documents, describing how a webpage should look by prescribing colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. 
CSS provides developers and designers with powerful control over the presentation of HTML elements.

HTML uses tags and CSS uses rulesets. CSS styles are applied to the HTML element using selectors.
CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.
